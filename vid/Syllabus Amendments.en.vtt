00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:08.610
Hi! Welcome back to philosophy 112, the
online only version! This is a brief

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.040
video in which I am going to explain the
changes that I made to the syllabus, to

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.189
take account of the fact that now we're
online. Let me open up the course web

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.140
page and show it to you. So the course
web page is the same:

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:34.770
davidsanson.com/logic. I've added some
new tabs to the page. I'm going to be

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.309
talking about the syllabus. I've also
added a course guide I've added a link

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.190
to reggienet because we're gonna make
more use of reggienet than we had before.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.980
you can read the entire syllabus on your
own I'm going to try to keep the short

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:58.289
and focus on what I think are the most
important things the tutors are still

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.969
tutoring if you need tutoring you can
contact making it Patrick it won't be

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:10.710
face to face obviously contact them by
email the tutors are undergraduate

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.909
students just like you going through all
the same weirdness as you are so please

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.590
be respectful of that the first major
change I got rid of the final two exams

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.840
and I'm replacing them with quizzes I
think this might actually just be an

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.890
improvement in a lot of ways it's
something that kind of wanted to do for

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.560
other reasons so I'm taking the chance
to do it now

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:43.470
so for example there is a quiz for this
module this syllabus amendments module

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.729
the syllabus amendments quiz like all
quizzes the quiz has three versions the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:02:00.360
idea is that you can take the quiz three
times by taking the three versions each

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.130
version of the quiz can only be taken
once but I will only count your highest

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.890
score from the three towards your quiz
grade

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.740
so if you take the first version and you
get a bad score that means that you

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.920
didn't understand something so you
should go back and you should study some

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.120
more and then try again you can only try
three times after you've done the third

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.040
version there isn't any more to do so
don't blow through all your attempts

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.090
quickly in hopes that you'll get lucky I
don't have any way to enforce a delay

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.570
between attempts if I could I would the
idea is you're feeling good about say

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:50.190
truth tables take the quiz on truth
tables if it goes badly well maybe you

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.430
shouldn't have been feeling so good
about truth tables go back study truth

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.250
tables some more maybe the next day come
and take the second version of the quiz

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:10.010
and see if you can do better that's the
idea I should say there's no especially

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.190
great and easy way to tell how well you
did on a quiz it's just like any other

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.770
assignment on Carnap so you can go to
your Carnap user page and you can scroll

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.440
down and you can see what score you got
on each question I've tried to give the

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.330
problems names that make that easy so
for example this elements amendments

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:42.900
quiz names for the version 1 let me go
to it the problems are amended syllabus

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:53.580
quiz 1.1 1.2 1.3 if you look at the
second version it's 2.1 2.2 2.3 and so

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:01.170
on okay
I intend these quizzes to be something

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.010
that you do on your own I don't intend
you to be working with other people on

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:16.470
the quizzes there's not any way that I
can really enforce that if I do discover

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.989
that you've been working together on the
quizzes then I will pursue that as an

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:28.380
act
misconduct case I'm not gonna make you

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.070
install a browser that looks over your
shoulder or whatever

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.530
that just seems disrespectful Court it's
worth the quizzes are intended to be

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.280
something that you do on your own
they are timed there's no way for me to

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:50.220
time them and they're open-book
opennotes so that's what that is

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:58.410
so the next big change is homework I am
still going to assign homework but I am

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.660
changing the way that your homework
grade will be calculated for the term so

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.550
if you had completed all of the homework
that was due prior to Spring Break you

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:17.220
would now have 1,075 homework points for
the class some of you have that many

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.870
points some of you have very close to
that many points most of you don't a lot

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:28.770
of you have 400 points 500 points 600
points I'm going to calculate your

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.080
homework grade for the entire course by
taking all the points you earned by the

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:40.050
end of the term as a percentage out of
1,000 so that means that if you already

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.250
have more than a thousand homework
points you've already gotten 100% on the

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.290
homework additional homework assignments
for you are entirely optional they're

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:56.220
just an opportunity to practice and
learn for everyone else that means that

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:02.070
new homework assignments will improve
your homework grade they that that's

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.000
what they'll do so when calculating your
course grade I'm going to use that

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.990
percentage out of a thousand each new
problem you complete should increase

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:16.290
that percentage so gradually your
percentage will go up until it hits the

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:23.190
cap of 100% you know get credit for
stuff over a hundred percent so that

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.700
means that depending on the rest of your
grades and principal each new homework

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.210
assignment or homework problem could be
the thing that bumps you up a full

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:36.080
letter grade
the way the grade will be calculated I'm

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.440
eliminating due dates for the new
homework I'm keeping them for the old

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.210
homework so you can still go back and
get two points for old overdue late

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.620
problems on the old homework assignments
for new homework assignments they're all

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:56.310
due on Friday of finals week which just
means that there isn't a difference

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.310
between what points you'll get for doing
them and now versus turning them in then

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:07.470
it's not it's not because I want you to
put all your homework off it's just that

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.170
I want you to be able to work at your
own pace and so I'm not going to enforce

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:17.550
due dates these policies are in some
ways quite generous but in other ways

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:22.620
not like I said many of you currently
have say 400 points or 500 points on

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:27.060
homework under the old system I would
have viewed that as a pretty good

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:32.220
showing and I would have curved your
final homework grades maybe that would

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.300
have ended up being a C to have say 500
points out of a thousand on the homework

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.580
that means that more than half of the
homework was done correctly on time

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:48.540
right since you get 40% for the late
stuff so actually doesn't mean that I

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:52.620
whatever I'm not good at math anyways
that means that you did some homework on

00:07:52.620 --> 00:08:00.240
time correctly and you've done a lot of
homework perhaps late but correctly I'm

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.770
not gonna be curving your homework
percentage on the new scheme so if you

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:09.150
have 500 points right now to get a
d-minus you need to move that up to 600

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:14.430
points to get it to be a c-minus you
need to move that up to 700 points and

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:19.380
so on so you've got six weeks there'll
be lots and lots of homework points

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.970
available and you'll be able to see in
your reggienet gradebook as those

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:31.230
numbers climb I've also enabled the
reggienet forums and in an effort to

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:35.520
encourage participation there I'm going
to reward helpful responses to peer

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:41.300
questions on the forums with some extra
homework points so that's homework

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:49.550
your guide to the course going forward
is the guide page that's where all of

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:55.550
the modules are that's where I assume
you found this module and this video you

00:08:55.550 --> 00:09:01.610
can get there by clicking guide you can
also just right at the top of the page

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:10.040
there as guide so the guide page has a
schedule this is a recommended schedule

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.300
for progression through the modules
before the end of the term

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:20.800
it also has then all of the modules so
there's the syllabus amendments module

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:27.500
there's a sentential logic module and
there's predicate logic modules I should

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.100
say as I'm recording this not all these
modules are complete

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:37.010
many of these links are broken right now
as I record I have completed the syntax

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:42.590
and parsing in translation modules for
sentential logic my goal is by the

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:47.600
beginning of our first week back in
class to have all of the sentential

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.470
logic modules done and then to make
quick progress on the predicate logic

00:09:51.470 --> 00:10:05.180
modules as well go back so the bulk of
the course is online a synchronic

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:10.520
you're working through stuff ask
questions on the forums I am NOT going

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:16.340
to try to replace class time directly
with set zoom lectures or anything like

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:20.270
that I'm not going to give long video
lectures that are meant to replace him I

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:25.190
wasn't doing that in class anyways what
I am going to do is I'm going to set

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:29.720
aside plenty of time when I'm available
to chat over email on the forums or via

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:35.900
zoom right now my plan is to have those
set times be Tuesdays and Thursdays 9:30

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:42.530
to 12:30 in the morning that's the same
times as our course meetings were while

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:49.250
we were face to face head to classes one
was at 935 the other one anyways so I

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:53.780
don't know whether those times are gonna
work for people now since everything has

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.340
changed
but that's my starting point and we'll

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:01.200
adjust as we need to during that time
I'll be active on email I'll be active

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.540
on the forums and I'll have an open zoom
meeting where people can drop in that

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.860
can become an impromptu discussion that
can be an office hour if it is

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:17.220
appropriate I'll record it and post it
to the modules so that gives you extra

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:22.650
things you can watch problems being
solved and so forth so how's your grade

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:28.350
can be calculated 25% homework 25%
midterm 150 percent these new quizzes

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:34.110
because they've replaced midterm two and
they were replacing the final you can

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:38.940
think of the quizzes as being the two
exams just smeared out over six weeks

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:45.060
rather than lumped up into two two
moments some discussion here about

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.680
exactly how the grade gets calculated
you can work through that on your own I

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:55.260
am gonna use the reggienet gradebook
going forward there's no good way for me

00:11:55.260 --> 00:12:00.480
to automate the way that the reggienet
gradebook and carne apps homework stuff

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.440
works together I have to do that myself
by hand so I'm trying to get it as

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:09.870
automated as possible using an Excel
spreadsheet right now what you can see

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:16.260
in your gradebook is your homework grade
which is just your percentage out of a

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:21.450
thousand for the homework points you
have right now your midterm grade and

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:26.310
then pretty soon you'll be able to see
your quizzes grades so your quiz grade

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:30.510
of course will be zero right so you'll
have an F and quizzes because that's

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:35.280
where you're gonna start and your
homework grade for reasons I explained

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:42.870
before could be an A or it could be you
know an F you can see your raw score in

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:53.300
the comments you'll see the percentage
as the grade so

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:58.580
the thought is that you can go to the
reggienet gradebook and you can see

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:06.950
where you're at right now I'm also going
to enable the automatically calculated

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:12.709
course grade on the reggienet gradebook
now that grade is gonna start out as an

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:18.500
F for everybody because the way I've set
it up is it's the grade you would get if

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:24.170
you didn't do anything else and you just
stopped completely so it's the grade you

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:30.260
have earned so far in that sense it's
how where you're at towards completing

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.709
the class so for example if you have
100% on the homework and you've got a

00:13:33.709 --> 00:13:37.519
hundred percent on the midterm and
you've done none of the quizzes that's

00:13:37.519 --> 00:13:42.680
fifty percent fifty percent is an F so
your grade for the course right now is

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:47.060
an F as you start doing quizzes your
percentage will rise and as your

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:52.519
percentage Rises your grade will rise
and as you're at any given moment the

00:13:52.519 --> 00:13:57.170
grade that you see there represents the
grade you would get if you just don't do

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:03.470
anything else if you just decide you're
done I'm a little bit conflicted about

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:08.029
this I worry that it's going to
encourage people to work up to a certain

00:14:08.029 --> 00:14:13.100
point and then just stop so for example
especially if you're stressed out with

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.610
other things this is really weird all
your classes are online you're stuck at

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:20.959
home you might get your grade to the
point where it's a C and you might

00:14:20.959 --> 00:14:26.270
decide ah screw it I don't want to do
anything else I'm done nothing stops you

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:30.649
from doing that if that is what you in
fact decide to do then you'll get the C

00:14:30.649 --> 00:14:34.839
in the class but I would hate to see you
sell yourself short

00:14:34.839 --> 00:14:42.170
just because I'm giving you this
information same thing goes for people

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:46.100
who manage to make it up to 90% but
haven't completed the whole course and

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:51.589
they're like oh okay well I guess I've
got my a I'm done with this I hope that

00:14:51.589 --> 00:14:54.529
if you get yourself in that position
you're enjoying logic enough you're

00:14:54.529 --> 00:14:58.459
interested in it enough that you keep
going and try to learn as much of it as

00:14:58.459 --> 00:15:05.149
you can that's I think at least the way
you ought to do University even in these

00:15:05.149 --> 00:15:08.790
weird times
but again there's no mechanisms in place

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:13.380
that enforce any of that those are just
my hopes you can check your gradebook

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:17.250
and if your gradebook says that you have
a grade and if that grade is the grade

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:22.620
that you're ok with then you can treat
this classes over and done with and

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:29.070
something you don't need to worry about
anymore like I say the gradebook is not

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:32.910
going to update automatically I have to
do that manually I'm going to come up

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:37.980
with a schedule for when I do that so
that you can reliably know when you're

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:44.640
going to be able to check I don't have
that scheduled yet that's it for the

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:50.970
syllabus I encourage you to take the
syllabus quiz I encourage you to then go

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:56.940
back to the guide and start working
through the sentential logic modules in

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:01.649
effect you will be doing the review that
we had planned to do in our face-to-face

00:16:01.649 --> 00:16:08.490
course building up to the second midterm
that's what the modules cover ok this is

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:13.279
weird having everything be online I'm
gonna miss seeing you guys face to face

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:17.850
don't be a stranger
be in touch let me know if you have any

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:22.230
problems any questions any puzzles if
you find typos if there are broken links

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:29.550
that shouldn't be broken feel free to
drop in to the Xoom meetings if those

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:35.310
zoom meeting times don't work for you
let me know and we will work on times

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:40.200
that work for as many people as possible
and there'll be office hours that our

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:45.500
appointment possibilities outside those
times too okay hope you're doing well

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.500
bye
